      <h2>Week 1 — Project Concept & Vision</h2>
      <p class="blog-meta">Posted by Team • January 2026</p>

      <p>
        This week, our team focused on establishing a clear concept and vision for our game,
        AstrOh-No! We aimed to define the core gameplay mechanics, art style, and overall
        narrative direction.
      </p>

      <h3>What We Worked On</h3>
      <p>
        We conducted brainstorming sessions to outline the game's key features and themes.
        The team created mood boards to visualize the art style and began drafting the
        narrative framework.
      </p>

      <h3>Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        One challenge we faced was aligning everyone's vision for the game. To address this,
        we scheduled additional meetings to ensure all team members could contribute their
        ideas and feedback.
      </p>

      <h3>Next Steps</h3>
      <p>
        Outline goals for next week. We plan to start prototyping the core mechanics and
        establishing the visual style.
