        <h2>Week 3 - Development Deep Dive</h2>
        <p class="blog-meta">Posted by Team • January 28, 2026</p>

        <p>
          This week, our team continued working on AstrOh-No! in our divided
          sectors. The work done this week was heavy on concepts, brainstorming,
          then putting ideas into place to create a set piece storyline our team
          can follow to continue game production.
        </p>

        <h3>What We Worked On</h3>
        Our visual artist has been busy in the lab, drafting up different styles
        the ship could take in the end product, as well as drafting up looks for
        the tools used throughout the game. The mechanics wrench, fire
        extinguisher, batteries and sheet metals, which will be important
        consistent gameplay mechanics the player will need to master to succeed.

        <br /><br />
        In other news, our level designer has been busy working on different
        area types, boss types, and level features. There is also a set
        narrative plan now, where the game follows a storyline of two workers on
        a ship, sucked into a black hole and adventure from level to level
        trying to get back home. A few level ideas have also been accepted to be
        worked on for our final project. Examples include: a “solar flare” level
        where a sun in the background shoots off solar rays which damage the
        player and set fire to the ship, so it needs to be avoided and fires put
        out. An ice level, where ice asteroids slow the player on impact,
        freezing them if hit twice in a short amount of time. Finally, a gas
        level, where poison gas clouds float by damaging whatever is in its
        path. There are more levels planned, you’ll just have to stay tuned!

        <br /><br />
        Our visual artist, Jordan, this week began work on backgrounds (as
        pictured) as well as other important assets. With his own ideas and
        ideas of the level designer, he can take off illustrating the ships,
        enemies, player, and tasks in AstrOh-No!

        The programmers this week continue to work on game logic, implementing
        movement, and basic asteroid behavior, with the story and level design
        in mind, they can begin working on more of the actual game. This is the
        agenda for next week, where the programmers continue working on the
        game, the artists continue making assets, the level designer irons out
        level placements and mechanics, while the project manager continues
        working on documentation.
