        <h2>Week 2 - Development Beginnings</h2>
        <p class="blog-meta">Posted by Team • January 21, 2026</p>

        <p>
          This week, after Wesley, our project manager, finished the game
          proposal 2.0, and moved onto the game design document, our team split
          off in order to begin development of AstrOh-No! in its different
          sectors.
        </p>

        <h3>What We Worked On</h3>
        Our programmers, Davis and Brian, were tasked this week to begin coding
        and implementing the base logic for our game. They were given things
        like player movement, player attacking, ship repairing, and object
        throwing. This was a challenge, as without proper assets to visualize
        the actions the player took, they had to substitute their own temporary
        assets to get a good feel for the movement and player action systems.

        <br /><br />
        On the asset side, this week, Veron was tasked with level design. He
        drafted a few pages of ideas for the game, from different level designs,
        different styles and difficulties of enemies, bosses and mini bosses,
        and base level design for the start of the game, which will be very
        helpful for the programmers.

        Our visual artist, Jordan, this week began work on backgrounds (as
        pictured) as well as other important assets. With his own ideas and
        ideas of the level designer, he can take off illustrating the ships,
        enemies, player, and tasks in AstrOh-No!

        />

        For the next week, our team continues developing their sections of
        AstrOh-No! The programmers continue implementing base logic for the game
        on Unity. The level designer and visual artist continue with asset and
        level creation and ideating, while the project manager will begin
        working on the game design document, while checking in with the
        different groups and collaborating in the different sectors.
